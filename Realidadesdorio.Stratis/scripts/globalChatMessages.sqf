	Name: globalChatMessages.sqf
	Version: 1.0.0
	Author: soulkobk (soulkobk.blogspot.com)
	Creation Date: 5:31 PM 18/10/2016
	Modification Date: 5:31 PM 18/10/2016
	
	Description:
	For use with A3Wasteland 1.Xx mission (A3Wasteland.com).
	
	This script will show global chat messages to clients, as per the _globalChatMessages array.
	Be sure to set _globalChatMessagesSleep at minimum of 10 minutes sleep duration, else the
	script will default	back to 10 minutes sleep duration to avoid spamming globalChat and
	annoying the hell out of players.
	
	Place this script in directory...
	\client\functions\globalChatMessages.sqf
	
	Edit...
	\client\init.sqf
	
	And at the bottom of the script, paste in...
	[] execVM "client\functions\globalChatMessages.sqf";
	
	*Please note that this is a static message, so if server administrators want to modify the
	messages contained, they need to update this script within their mission.pbo each time.
	
	*Please also note that this script is based upon having a 'game logic' named 'server' within
	your mission.sqm file (it should be in the vanilla A3Wasteland mission already, if not then
	you must add a game logic to your mission and name it 'server').
	
	Parameter(s): for _globalChatMessages, use syntax -> ["<message>",<sleep time in seconds>],

	Example: none
	
	Change Log:
	1.0.0 -	original base script.
